# social-network-api

## Description

Social Network API was created to allow users to network with each other on the application by posting their thoughts. THis application allows the user to enter, update, create, and delete their user account and thoughts. Through this project I was able to showcase my understanding regarding how to utilize Mongoose to create an application or program.
